Interactive PHQ9/GAD7 questionnaire and statistical analysis

Too often, especially with depression and anxiety, our perception of the past 2 weeks (which we are asked to summarize in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionairres) is disproportionately influenced by our current mood. This app will allow for a more objective summary of the past two weeks by providing a response suggestion based on daily answers to PHQ-9 questions that have been modified to better assess mood on a given day. 

App have the capability to:
  - administer standard PHQ9
  - administer a "daily" version of the PHQ9
  - administer standard GAD7
  - administer a "daily" version of the GAD7
  - have an easy interface to identify mood, eating habits, etc at time of questionairre administration
  - save user data and... 
      - display trends
      - perform statistical analysis to identify patterns in mood, eating, answers to specific questions, etc
      - give a "past two weeks" summary based on daily questionairre answers
  - provide a "suggested answer" for each PHQ-9 question based on daily ansers
